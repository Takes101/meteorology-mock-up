## Description
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Here is an application which displays the weather forecast of any U.S. city, including the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. The five-day future forecast is also shown.

Information of the cities is stored using localStorage and users can click on saved cities in order to view their forecasts again. One can clear the list of stored cities using the "Clear Search History" button.
